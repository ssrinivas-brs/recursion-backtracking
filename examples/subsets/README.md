## Subsets

The subsets function generates all possible subsets of a given array nums. It uses recursion to explore the choices of including or excluding each element in the array. At each step, it either adds the current element to the auxArr (temporary subset) or excludes it. When the recursion reaches the end of the array, it adds the computed auxArr to the final res array, representing all possible subsets. The function returns a 2D array containing all subsets of the input nums.
