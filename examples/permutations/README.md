## Permutation

The permute function generates all possible permutations of a given array letters. It uses depth-first search (DFS) with backtracking to explore different combinations of elements in the array. The function maintains a path of selected elements and an array to mark used elements. When a valid permutation of the entire array is found, it is added to the result variable res. The function returns an array containing all possible permutations of the input letters.
